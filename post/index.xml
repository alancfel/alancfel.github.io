However, studying surfaces is important, as they lay the foundation for heterogeneous catalysis, heterostructure devices, 2D materials, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Femtosecond angle-resolved photoemission, ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction, ultrafast grazing incidence X-ray scattering, ultrafast infrared reflection and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy have been used and play main roles in studying the ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics of surfaces. If the surfaces are buried, for example, in solid-bulk liquid interfaces or heterostructure bulk junctions, applying electron-based ultrafast characterization techniques to these systems can be challenging due to their small penetration depth. Ultrafast sum-frequency generation nonlinear spectroscopy (SFG) shows its advantage for these systems. SFG probes the second-order susceptibilities χ(2) of the materials. It equals zero for centrally symmetric bulk materials, thus providing surface and interface sensitivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this contribution, we reported the development of an ultra-high vacuum setup that integrates conventional surface science techniques with azimuthal and polarization-dependent, femtosecond time-resolved sum-frequency generation spectroscopy and scanning sum-frequency generation microscopy. With a series of proof-of-principle measurements of CO adsorbed on Pt(111) and of the clean Ag(111) surface, we demonstrate that the setup offers 34 fs temporal resolution to perform time-resolved SFG spectroscopy, sufficient manipulator stability to perform scanning SFG microscopy on ~40 μm length scales, and flexible sample rotation to perform azimuthal-dependent SFG spectroscopy. This setup allows for the full characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility under equilibrium and femtosecond optically excited non-equilibrium conditions, as well as temperature control and sample preparation/characterization of conventional UHV setups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building a setup combining several ultrahigh vacuum chambers with sophisticated laser beam paths from scratch is challenging. We hope this contribution will be of interest to scientists in the fields of surface science, physical chemistry, materials science, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our recent paper, published in PNAS, describes the method of generating/blowing glycerol bubbles under vacuum using picosecond infrared laser pulses (through laser-induced spallation) and imaging them with a nanosecond pulse illuminated bright-field optical microscope. Through the analysis of the bubble dynamics, we uncovered a transient rubber-like elasticity in the thin liquid glycerol film. In a previous study, we demonstrated the applicability of these thin liquid bubbles/films for liquid ultrafast electron diffraction experiments. The method can also be very useful in the field of rheology to reveal the mechanical properties of liquids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We constructed the setup and obtained these experimental results over three years ago. Many thanks to all the co-authors, Meghanad Kayanattil, Dr. Sascha W. Epp, and Djordje Gitaric, for the careful analysis and for finally getting it published, as well as for the support from the MPI for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter.&lt;/p>

Kramer Campen and Dr. Zhipeng Huang within the general topic of femtoelectrochemistry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our group, we address fundamental questions in the mechanism of (photo)electrocatalytic chemistry by conducting experiments in which we initiate and probe electron (and coupled proton) transfer with femtosecond timescales using nonlinear optical and optoelectric tools. In the near term, this work will involve the description of water electrolysis and small organic molecule oxidation on Pt and Co-Ferrites. In pursuit of such understanding, experiments will be conducted both at well-defined surfaces in ultra-high vacuum and under potential-control within thin film spectroelectrochemical cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All positions offer contracts for three years with possible extension based on good performance and availability of funds, and will be paid according to the public service’s wage agreement (E13 TV-L, 66% in year 1 and 75% thereafter).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applicants should have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in physics, chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, or a related field with a good GPA (1.5 or better in the German system or equivalent). Applicants should have experience in experimental physics or chemistry and good English language skills. Programming experience, ideally Labview or Julia, and experience with ultrafast lasers, would both be a bonus, but are not required. Depending on interest, it is anticipated that the successful applicants will become graduate students in either the Integrated Graduate School Solvation Science (a part of the German Research Foundation-funded RESOLV (Ruhr Explores Solvation) Cluster of Excellence) or the Integrated Research Training Group “Understanding Oxidation Catalysis” (a part of the German Research Foundation-supported Collaborative Research Center 247 “Heterogeneous Oxidation Catalysis in the Liquid Phase”). In either case, the association offers supplementary workshops, travel support for meetings, and support for internships with international collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To initiate an application or to obtain further information, please contact Dr. Huang (&lt;a href="mailto:zhipeng.huang@uni-due.de">zhipeng.huang@uni-due.de&lt;/a>) or Prof. Campen (&lt;a href="mailto:richard.campen@uni-due.de">richard.campen@uni-due.de&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application should include a curriculum vitae, transcripts of grades from Bachelor and Master studies, title and abstract of Bachelor and Master thesis (if applicable), a list of publications (if applicable), the contact information of at least two professional references, and a brief statement on why you would like to pursue your studies in the group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With varying the ablation laser fluence or the time delay, we can deliver either gas-phase or liquid-phase samples to the electron/light pulse interaction point. Our methodology provides time separable nanoscale liquid phase and gas-phase sample delivery under identical conditions to enable atomic imaging using electron sources and determination of solvation effects and is promising to extend to large biomolecules under either isolated gas-phase or solvated environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As an experimental physicist, we spent most of our efforts on the technique aspects, e.g. build setups, commission them, measure physical quantities more precisely, pursuit experiments that beyond current capability, etc.. A better understanding of the physics/principles behind the experiments is needed to explain the results thoroughly. References in the link are very helpful to connect the theories to the experimental results.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The past two annual meetings were organized in the same format and turned out to be of great success (see &lt;a href="http://gcpd.eu/2021_web/program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://gcpd.eu/2021_web/program.html&lt;/a> for example). We will feel really privileged if you could attend the event.&lt;/p>
