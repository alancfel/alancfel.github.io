However, studying surfaces is important, as they lay the foundation for heterogeneous catalysis, heterostructure devices, 2D materials, etc.\nFemtosecond angle-resolved photoemission, ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction, ultrafast grazing incidence X-ray scattering, ultrafast infrared reflection and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy have been used and play main roles in studying the ultrafast non-equilibrium dynamics of surfaces. If the surfaces are buried, for example, in solid-bulk liquid interfaces or heterostructure bulk junctions, applying electron-based ultrafast characterization techniques to these systems can be challenging due to their small penetration depth. Ultrafast sum-frequency generation nonlinear spectroscopy (SFG) shows its advantage for these systems. SFG probes the second-order susceptibilities χ(2) of the materials. It equals zero for centrally symmetric bulk materials, thus providing surface and interface sensitivity.\nIn this contribution, we reported the development of an ultra-high vacuum setup that integrates conventional surface science techniques with azimuthal and polarization-dependent, femtosecond time-resolved sum-frequency generation spectroscopy and scanning sum-frequency generation microscopy. With a series of proof-of-principle measurements of CO adsorbed on Pt(111) and of the clean Ag(111) surface, we demonstrate that the setup offers 34 fs temporal resolution to perform time-resolved SFG spectroscopy, sufficient manipulator stability to perform scanning SFG microscopy on ~40 μm length scales, and flexible sample rotation to perform azimuthal-dependent SFG spectroscopy. This setup allows for the full characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility under equilibrium and femtosecond optically excited non-equilibrium conditions, as well as temperature control and sample preparation/characterization of conventional UHV setups.\nBuilding a setup combining several ultrahigh vacuum chambers with sophisticated laser beam paths from scratch is challenging. We hope this contribution will be of interest to scientists in the fields of surface science, physical chemistry, materials science, etc.\nThere is the link of the publication.

However, the former provides no microscopic insights and the latter assumes that the timescale of solvent structural fluctuation dynamics (solvent vibrations) is well separated from that of electron transfer dynamics. As a result its applicability to systems where there is strong interaction between the electrode and the reactant/product , and thus the timescales may be similar, is limited. Such systems are of particular importance in many catalytic reactions.\nWhile important, experimental study of these elementary processes are extremely challenging. One needs to create a vibrational excitation at an electrode/electrolyte interface at a well-defined time and probe the associated current or voltage change as this excitation thermalizes. Because vibrational lifetimes in aqueous solution are typically 0.01-10s of picoseconds this implies that current or voltage resolution on these timescales is required. Such time scales are not possible by conventional electrochemical techniques.\nIn this study we create imperfect, monocomponent Ferrocene-terminated alkane thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au and place them inside a thin-film spectroelectrochemical cell kept at open circuit conditions. To explore the relationship of particular vibrations to charge transfer, we electronically excite the Ferrocene with a femtosecond pulse in the visible and vibrationally excite the system using a femtosecond pulse in the mid-infrared in resonance with the aromatic C-H stretch vibrations. The resulting two photon photovoltage (2PPV) signal is then measured as a function of delay between the infrared and visible pulses. We find the Ferrocene coupled surface state is electronically excited, and relaxes, on a timescale ~120 fs. However this electronically excited state relaxes to a nonequilibrium ground state electronic structure under open circuit conditions, Ferrocenium, whose subsequent relaxation back to Ferrocene can be induced by aromatic CH stretch excitation leading to an additional 4 ps timescale in the photovoltage response. Interestingly the photon energy of the CH stretch, ~0.4 eV, is 1/2 that estimated for the perfect, bicomponent, Ferrocene terminated alkane thiol SAM. To our knowledge these results are the first measurement of mode-specific charge transfer at an electrode-electrolyte interface. Because the technique is quite general, and the type of reactions where this effect is likely to occur are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, we expect it to be of wide interest.\n Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
