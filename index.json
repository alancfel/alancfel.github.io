Presence meetings will be hosted in Berlin (Germany) and Changchun (China) in parallel. Online participation will be also an option.\nThe purpose of the annual conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners with a background related to physics from Germany and China together to discuss the recent scientific and technological advancements in their fields, as well as strengthen the scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation between China and Germany in the post-pandemic era. On behalf of the organization committee, we would like to invite you to attend this event.\nThe past two annual meetings were organized in the same format and turned out to be of great success (see http://gcpd.eu/2021_web/program.html for example). We will feel really privileged if you could attend the event.\nYou can find more information on the registration and programs below.\nConference register link: https://forms.office.com/r/8uV5MHtRTZ Conference webpage: http://gcpd.eu/2022_web/index.html\nYours faithfully,\nDr. Zhipeng Huang\non behalf of GCPD-2022 organization committee\n  Download the conference program.\n","date":1660780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660944875,"objectID":"d3bee38d9fab493e4a217eedda9d02a0","permalink":"https://zhipeng-huang.netlify.app/post/gcpd_2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gcpd_2022/","section":"post","summary":"The 31st annual conference of GCPD will be held in a hybrid format on 16th-17th September of this year at Berlin (Germany), Changchun (China) and online in parallel.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"The 31st Annual Conference of Gesellschaft Chinesischer Physiker in Deutschland (GCPD) e.V.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system is important to study the solid-gas interface, where many catalytic process happens, e.g. CO oxidation at Platinum surface.\nMy main project at University of Duisburg-Essen is building an UHV system, which integrates LEED/AES, TPD and SFG.\nThe UHV system has already been built up and worked well.

However, the former provides no microscopic insights and the latter assumes that the timescale of solvent structural fluctuation dynamics (solvent vibrations) is well separated from that of electron transfer dynamics. As a result its applicability to systems where there is strong interaction between the electrode and the reactant/product , and thus the timescales may be similar, is limited. Such systems are of particular importance in many catalytic reactions.\nWhile important, experimental study of these elementary processes are extremely challenging. One needs to create a vibrational excitation at an electrode/electrolyte interface at a well-defined time and probe the associated current or voltage change as this excitation thermalizes. Because vibrational lifetimes in aqueous solution are typically 0.01-10s of picoseconds this implies that current or voltage resolution on these timescales is required. Such time scales are not possible by conventional electrochemical techniques.\nIn this study we create imperfect, monocomponent Ferrocene-terminated alkane thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au and place them inside a thin-film spectroelectrochemical cell kept at open circuit conditions. To explore the relationship of particular vibrations to charge transfer, we electronically excite the Ferrocene with a femtosecond pulse in the visible and vibrationally excite the system using a femtosecond pulse in the mid-infrared in resonance with the aromatic C-H stretch vibrations. The resulting two photon photovoltage (2PPV) signal is then measured as a function of delay between the infrared and visible pulses. We find the Ferrocene coupled surface state is electronically excited, and relaxes, on a timescale ~120 fs. However this electronically excited state relaxes to a nonequilibrium ground state electronic structure under open circuit conditions, Ferrocenium, whose subsequent relaxation back to Ferrocene can be induced by aromatic CH stretch excitation leading to an additional 4 ps timescale in the photovoltage response. Interestingly the photon energy of the CH stretch, ~0.4 eV, is 1/2 that estimated for the perfect, bicomponent, Ferrocene terminated alkane thiol SAM. To our knowledge these results are the first measurement of mode-specific charge transfer at an electrode-electrolyte interface. Because the technique is quite general, and the type of reactions where this effect is likely to occur are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, we expect it to be of wide interest.\n Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
