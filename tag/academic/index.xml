&lt;p>The Society of Chinese Physicists in Germany (GCPD, &lt;a href="http://gcpd.eu/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://gcpd.eu/index.htm&lt;/a>) is organizing its 31st annual conference which will be held in a hybrid format on 16th-17th September of this year. Presence meetings will be hosted in Berlin (Germany) and Changchun (China) in parallel. Online participation will be also an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of the annual conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners with a background related to physics from Germany and China together to discuss the recent scientific and technological advancements in their fields, as well as strengthen the scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation between China and Germany in the post-pandemic era. On behalf of the organization committee, we would like to invite you to attend this event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The past two annual meetings were organized in the same format and turned out to be of great success (see &lt;a href="http://gcpd.eu/2021_web/program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://gcpd.eu/2021_web/program.html&lt;/a> for example). We will feel really privileged if you could attend the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find more information on the registration and programs below.&lt;/p>

October 2013.
This fellowship was awarded before he started his PhD at DESY. It supported him to develop the large molecule source for free-electron laser experiments, which is the core part of his PhD dissertation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find more information in the DESY newsletter.&lt;/p>
