As a result, I would like to share the link here to anyone interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an experimental physicist, we spent most of our efforts on the technique aspects, e.g. build setups, commission them, measure physical quantities more precisely, pursuit experiments that beyond current capability, etc.. A better understanding of the physics/principles behind the experiments is needed to explain the results thoroughly. References in the link are very helpful to connect the theories to the experimental results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another valuable physics material is the Feynman Lectures on Physics (&lt;a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)&lt;/a>, which I read during my undergraduate study. It is one of the best physics textbooks I would like to recommend.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
